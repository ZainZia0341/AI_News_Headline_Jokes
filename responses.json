[{"prompt": "KEARNY, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 A wildfire burned down two structures and was threatening more than 50 others in the small desert community of Kearny, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nThe Simmons Fire, which broke out Tuesday, has burned 475 acres with zero containment, said Tiffany Davila, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management.\n\nAbout 180 residents remained under mandatory evacuation in Kearny, which is located 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of Tucson and has a population of about 1,800.\n\nBurning through dry fuels including grass and brush, the blaze was threatening a water treatment plant, copper mine, school district office and railroad line.\n\nPinal County officials said the town's Riverside neighborhood was evacuated Tuesday night, with a shelter opened at an elementary school.\n\nOfficials cut off electricity in northern Kearny for safety reasons, and four air tankers were fighting the fire along with crews on the ground.", "response": "\"\\nHere is the homorous joke on news headline: \\n\\nDid you hear about the fire that started in Kearny? It's like a game of \\\"Where's Waldo?\\\" except with flames and smoke. And let's not forget about the mandatory evacuation, because it's not like you can just book a last-minute getaway to avoid the chaos.\"", "review": "this is good joke."}]
